## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
See milestones/v1.1-ROADMAP.md for full v1.1 decision history.

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- GRT community database on GitHub (zen/grt_databases) has only 12 powder files. Full 200+ dataset may require GRT installation export.
- Bullet data compilation (500+ bullets) requires manual work from manufacturer specs -- no automated source exists.
