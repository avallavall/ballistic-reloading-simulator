<current_state>
Milestone v1.3 audit completed. Gap closure phases 14 and 15 have been added to the roadmap but neither has been planned or executed yet. Phase 14 is the next phase to plan.

Phases 11-13 are fully complete and verified. Phase 14 directory exists but is empty (no plans). Phase 15 directory also exists but is empty.
</current_state>

<completed_work>

- Phase 11: Foundation and Data Expansion - Complete (schema extensions, geometry engine, 506 bullets)
- Phase 12: 2D SVG Technical Drawings - Complete (3-tab viewer, export, deep links)
- Phase 13: 3D Parametric Cartridge Viewer - Complete (R3F, cutaway, orbit controls, code splitting)
- Milestone audit: v1.3-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md created, score 14/21 requirements satisfied
- Gap closure: Phase 14 directory created, Phase 15 added to roadmap, REQUIREMENTS.md updated (VIS2-03 reset to Pending)
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

- Phase 14: Browser Upload and Caliber-Scoped Search — needs `/gsd:plan-phase 14` then execution
  - DATA-02: Upload bullet data via JSON with preview and collision handling
  - DATA-03: Upload cartridge data via JSON with preview and collision handling
  - DATA-04: Upload bullet/cartridge data via CSV (strict format) with preview
  - DATA-05: Community data quality badge capped at danger (max 35/100)
  - DATA-06: Safety warning banner for community-sourced components
  - SRCH-01: Caliber-filtered parametric powder search
  - SRCH-02: Caliber filter optional and backward-compatible
- Phase 15: Assembly Deep Link Integration Fix — needs `/gsd:plan-phase 15` then execution
  - Fix simulate → drawings data handoff (simulation data lost on navigation)
  - Remove dead powderChargeGrains prop from CartridgeViewer3D
- Re-audit milestone after both phases complete
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- Grouped all 7 unsatisfied requirements into existing Phase 14 (already scoped in roadmap)
- Created new Phase 15 for the OBT overlay integration gap (VIS2-03) + tech debt cleanup
- Folded tech debt (dead powderChargeGrains prop) into Phase 15 rather than deferring
- Reset VIS2-03 checkbox in REQUIREMENTS.md from [x] to [ ] since audit found integration broken
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
- None. Both phases are ready for planning.

<context>
The v1.3 milestone is 14/21 requirements satisfied. All visual phases (11-13) shipped successfully. The remaining work is data contribution (upload UI + safety gates) and caliber search. Phase 15 is a small integration fix (~2-3 tasks). Phase 14 is the larger piece with 7 requirements spanning backend upload endpoints, frontend upload UI, quality badges, safety warnings, and caliber-filtered search.

User prefers team-based workflow: spawn specialized agents (backend-dev, frontend-dev, qa-engineer) and coordinate via tasks. Don't code directly.

<next_action>
Start with: `/gsd:plan-phase 14` (clear context first with `/clear`)

After Phase 14 is planned and executed, plan and execute Phase 15, then re-audit with `/gsd:audit-milestone`.
